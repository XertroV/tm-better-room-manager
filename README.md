# Better Room Manager

Administer Club Rooms: save/load presets, add random maps, set hidden script options, and more.

Better Room Manager is an alternate management UI for Club rooms.

It currently supports:
* creating and editing rooms
* script options: add hidden options, modify existing, load defaults, and documentation links
* adding known maps (in your Trackmania\Maps folder)
* adding random TMX maps within some constraints (length (seconds) and difficulty)
* saving and loading presets of room configurations (excludes: room name, maps, and whether the room is passworded)

Launch it from the Plugins menu ("Better Room Manager")
