# Better Room Manager

Better Room Manager is an alternate management UI for Club rooms that works for Creators, Admins, and Content CreatorsÂ¹.

It currently supports:
* creating and editing rooms
* saving and loading presets of room configurations (excludes: room name, maps, and whether the room is passworded)
* script options: add hidden options, modify existing, load defaults, and documentation links
* adding known maps (in your Trackmania\Maps folder) -- search by name or browse by folder
* adding random TMX maps within some constraints (length (seconds) and difficulty)
* adding maps from TMX via IDs or Map Pack ID (will auto-upload maps to nadeo if required)
* reorder maps or shuffle
* toggle room active status

Launch it from the Plugins menu ("Better Room Manager")

*\[1\]: Content Creators can only see active rooms. They can edit any active room and can create new rooms. They can also deactivate rooms, but this is behind a safety switch to avoid them locking themselves out of a room.*
